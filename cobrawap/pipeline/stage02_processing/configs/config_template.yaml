# Config file for Stage 2 - Processing

# Name of stage, must be identical with folder name
STAGE_NAME: 'stage02_processing'

# The profile name is the key for this parameter configuration. Results are stored in output_path/<PROFILE>/ (output_path is defined in settings.py)
PROFILE: 'dataset_key'

# Name of the output file
STAGE_OUTPUT: "processed_data"

# File format in which all intermediate neo objects are stored
NEO_FORMAT: 'nix'

# If True (default), the output file of a stage is created as symbolic link
# to the last block output. If False, a duplicate is created (e.g. for cloud
# application, where sym-links are not supported).
USE_LINK_AS_STAGE_OUTPUT: True

# Plotting parameters
PLOT_TSTART: 0  # float (in s) or 'None' -> starting time of the input signal is used
PLOT_TSTOP: 10  # float (in s) or 'None' -> stopping time of the input signal is used
PLOT_CHANNELS: 'None'  # int or None. default 'None' -> randomly selected
PLOT_FORMAT: 'png'

# The block order determines which processing steps (blocks) will be applied
# and in which order. Execution order is from first to last entry.
# The available blocks are:
# 'background_subtraction', 'frequency_filter', 'normalization', 'detrending',
# 'spatial_downsampling', 'roi_selection', 'logMUA_estimation', 'phase_transform',
# 'zscore', 'subsampling'
# Default: empty list [] -> it skips any processing blocks and returns the same
# as input but, different from plot obtained from stage01, here the values on
# the y-scale are correctly reported
BLOCK_ORDER: []

# To make sure that the processing blocks are always executed in the correct
# order that results from previous runs don't confound the workflow, all blocks
# are rerun upon each execution. To turn this off, e.g., because the block order
# didn't change, set to False (do with care!).

# BLOCK - normalization
#######################
# Normalize the data (divide channels-wise) by either:

# BLOCK - detrending
####################
# Detrending: 0 - mean detrending;

########################
MUA_HIGHPASS_FREQUENCY: 50  # in Hz
MUA_LOWPASS_FREQUENCY: 1200  # in Hz
# Rate of the logMUA signal. Must be <= the original sampling rate
# in Hz (default: 'None', takes highpass_frequency)
logMUA_RATE: 70
# Length of time slice (in s) to estimate the local power spectrum
# default 'None', takes minimum number of samples determined

FFT_SLICE: 0.1
# PSD_OVERLAP: determined by setting in block frequency_filter
