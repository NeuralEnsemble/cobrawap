Modular Pipeline Approach
=========================
The design of the pipeline aims at interfacing a variety of general and specific analysis and processing steps in a flexible modular manner. Hence, the pipeline is able to adapt to diverse types of data (e.g., electrical ECoG, or optical calcium imaging recordings) and to different analysis questions. This makes the analyses a) more reproducible and b) comparable among each other since they rely on the same stack of algorithms and any differences in the processing are fully transparent.
The individual processing and analysis steps, **Blocks**, are organized in sequential **Stages**. Following along the stages, the analysis becomes more specific but also allows to branch off at after any stage, as each stage yields useful intermediate results and is autonomous so that it can be reused and recombined. Within each stage, there is a collection of blocks from which the user can select and arrange the analysis via a config file. Thus, the pipeline can be thought of as a curated database of methods on which an analysis can be constructed by drawing a path along the blocks and stages.

Installation
============
*Online execution via* |EBRAINS|_ *will follow.*

.. |EBRAINS| replace:: *EBRAINS*
.. _EBRAINS: https://ebrains.eu/

Installation with PyPi
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ cobrawap


Manual Installation For Developers
----------------------------------
For working on the source code, it is recommended to fork the Cobrawap repository from Github, and clone it or set it as a submodule to another project repository.

`Create a fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_ in your github domain of the upstream location `github.com/INM-6/cobrawap <https://github.com/INM-6/cobrawap>`_ and clone the repository to your local machine (:code:`git clone git@github.com:<your-github-handle>/cobrawap.git`).

Then use pip to install the module from your local directory in an editable mode.
.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e <path-to-cobrawap-directory>

Pipeline Setup
==============

Initialization
--------------
See also `Command Line Interface > init <https://cobrawap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line_interface.html#init>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    cobrawap init

This will prompt the setting of path information for an output directory of the pipeline results and for a config directory where the pipeline config files are stored. Optionally, these paths can be directly passed to the :code:`init` command with :code:`--output_path` and :code:`--config_path`. These settings will be stored in ``~/.cobrawap/config``.

If the specified config directory is empty, this step will also create template config files for each stage and a template dataset loading script for the initial stage.


Creating Set of Configurations for a Dataset
--------------------------------------------
See also `Command Line Interface > create <https://cobrawap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line_interface.html#create>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    cobrawap create

This will prompt the setting of a profile name and optionally a parent profile name from which to copy the parameter presets. The parent profile name will be prepended to the profile name (see :ref:`config_profiles`). Optionally, these names can be directly passed to the :code:`create` command with :code:`--profile` and :code:`--parent_profile`.
The profile and parent name will be used to create correspondingly named config files for each stage: ``config_<parent>_<profile>.yaml`` for the first stage and ``config_<parent>.yaml`` for all other stages. 

For specifying the data entry into the pipeline :code:`create` also asks for the path to the dataset and a name for the corresponding loading script. This information can also be passed to the :code:`create` command with :code:`--data_path` and :code:`--loading_script_name`.
Both information are written into the corresponding config file of the first stage. Furthermore, a template loading script is created in ``<config_path>/stage01_data_entry/scripts/`` which has to be adapted to load the specific dataset.
A detailed guide to set up the data entry can be found in the `stage01 README <https://cobrawap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stage01_data_entry.html#entering-datasets-into-cobrawap>`_.


Adding a Configuration Profile
------------------------------
See also `Command Line Interface > add_profile <https://cobrawap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line_interface.html#add_profile>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    cobrawap add_profile

This will prompt the setting of a profile and parent profile name just as for :code:`cobrawap create`. Additionally, it requires to specify the stages for which to create new config files (can be directly passed with :code:`--stages`).
Consequently, this will create new config files ``config_<parent>_<profile>.yaml`` for the selected stages, copying the parameter presents from ``config_<parent>.yaml``.

If the stage selection includes the first stage, this will again prompt the additional setting of a :code:`--data_path` and :code:`--loading_script_name` as for :code:`cobrawap create`. 

Running the Pipeline
--------------------
Running the Full Pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
See also `Command Line Interface > run <https://cobrawap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line_interface.html#run>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    cobrawap run

This will prompt the setting of a profile to be executed (can be directly passed with :code:`--profile`).
The command line arguments can be extended with the specification of config parameters (in the format :code:`PARAMETER=value`) that will overwrite the corresponding parameter values in the config files. Any further command line arguments will be passed to :code:`snakemake`, see the `snakemake documentation <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cli.html>`_ for available command line arguments.

Running a Single Stage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
See also `Command Line Interface > run_stage <https://cobrawap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line_interface.html#run_stage>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    cobrawap run_stage

The behavior is identical to :code:`cobrawap run`, except for the additional specification of a stage, either prompted or directly with :code:`--stage`.


Running a Single Block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
See also `Command Line Interface > run_block <https://cobrawap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line_interface.html#run_block>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    cobrawap run_block

This command allows to execute the python script of a specific block. The block should be specified as :code:`<stage_name>.<block_name>` and can be passed with :code:`--block`. Any additional command line arguments are passed to the script. 

To display the help text of the block script add :code:`--block_help`.


Organization
============
- ``Snakefile`` defines how the stages are executed within the full pipeline
- ``configs/`` contains global config files
   - ``config.yaml`` defines the global parameter settings
- ``settings.py`` defines the ``output_path`` and ``configs_dir``
- ``scripts/`` contains general utility scripts
- ``stageXY/`` each stage is a separate folder
   - ``Snakefile`` defines the blocks (=rules) and organizes their interaction
   - ``scripts/`` contains the analysis and plotting scripts (~1 script per block)
   - ``configs/`` contains the parameter settings for this stage
      - ``config_{profile}.yaml`` ... with different settings for different profiles
   - ``README`` describes the stage's functionality

.. figure:: https://github.com/rgutzen/cobrawap/blob/master/doc/images/folder_structure.png
    :alt: Folder Structure
    :name: fig-folder_structure

**Figure: Folder Structure.** *The pipeline structure is reflected in the organization of the folders, here showing an excerpt of two stages and example blocks. Stages and blocks are folders and subfolders in the pipeline directory (middle row); the output of individual stages and blocks is stored with the same hierarchy of folders and subfolders (bottom row); the local configuration can act as an overlay to define config files and loading scripts (top row).*

Configuration
=============

Config Files
------------
There is one config file per stage, and one additional top-level config file that selects the stages and defines pipeline-wide parameters.
All config files are given as templates. So, in order to get started you need to copy/rename ``config_template.yaml`` to ``config.yaml`` in the corresponding folders, and edit to your needs.
See pipeline config template: |config template|_.

.. |config template| replace:: ``configs/config_template.yaml``
.. _config template: configs/config_template.yaml


Local Config Directory
----------------------
Similarly, you need to rename ``settings_template.py`` to ``settings.py`` and edit the containing ``output_path`` to fit your local system.
In the setting file, you can also optionally set a ``configs_dir`` path to define an alternative directory containing the config files. This alternative config directory mirrors the stage folder structure of the pipeline and can be used to configure the pipeline for specific projects without touching the cobrawap folder itself.

.. _config_profiles:

Config Profiles
---------------
Config profiles make it possible to group specific parameter configurations for different datasets or applications across stages, and easily switch between them. You can set the ``PROFILE`` parameter in the top-level config file (or via the command line when running the pipeline). The corresponding pipeline output will be stored in ``{output_path}/{profile}/``, and for each stage the specific config file ``{stage}/configs/config_{profile}.yaml`` is used. 

To reduce redundancy and the number of config files, profiles use a hierachical naming convention where each subgroup is seperated with an underscore ``_``, for example, ``config_ecog_session1_trial7.yaml``. When a stage does not contain this exact file name, it falls back onto the parent group (``config_ecog_session1.yaml``) and when it also doesn't exist onto its parent group (``config_ecog.yaml``) and so on. Thus, config specialization is only applied in the stages where it is needed. Furthermore, you can add variants to the profile name with a ``|`` delimiter to additionally switch analysis types, for example, ``config_caimg_session1|subsampled.yaml``.
The selection order is the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    config_some_profile|variant.yaml
    config_some|variant.yaml
    config|variant.yaml
    config_some_profile.yaml
    config_some.yaml
    config.yaml


Config Priority
---------------
*stage config < pipeline config < command line config*

Generally, all parameters are specified in the corresponding stage config files. However, any parameters can also be set in the top-level pipeline config. These then have priority and overwrite the values in all stages. This is useful, in particular, to specify the file formats (``NEO_FORMAT``, ``PLOT_FORMAT``) and plotting parameters (``PLOT_TSTART``, ``PLOT_TSTOP``, ``PLOT_CHANNELS``). Additionally, you can set parameters via the command line when executing the pipeline with the flag ``--config``. This is especially recommended for setting the profile (e.g. ``--config PROFILE="ecog_session1_trial7|highbeta"``).


Execution
=========
Cobrawap relies on the functionality of Snakemake to execute the pipeline, and therefore supports its additional features and command line arguments (see its `documentation <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cli.html>`_).

Running The Full Pipeline
-------------------------
Make sue all paths are set (``settings.py``) and the pipeline and stage configs are specified.
Then navigate to the ``cobrawap/pipeline/``.
When ``PROFILE`` is set accordingly in the pipeline config, the execution is a simple snakemake call:

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --cores=1


Otherwise, the profile (and other parameters) can be set directly via the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --config PROFILE={profile} --cores=1


Running Specific Stages
-----------------------
Navigate to the stage folder ``cobrawap/pipeline/<stage>/``. As each stage is a subworkflow it can be executed with the same snakemake calls as the full pipline. However, you need to manually specify the config file and stage input:

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --configfile='configs/config_{profile}.yaml' --config PROFILE={profile} STAGE_INPUT=/path/to/stage/input/file --cores=1


Running Specific Blocks
-----------------------
Each block is represented by a snakemake rule. To run a specific rule you can explicitly request its output file:

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake /path/to/specific/file --configfile='configs/config_{profile}.yaml' --config PROFILE={profile} STAGE_INPUT=/path/to/stage/input/file --cores=1


Keep in mind that snakemake keeps track of the timestamps of scripts, input, and output files. So, a rule will only be run again if any of its inputs has changed, and if something in the creation of the input changed this might also trigger the re-execution of other blocks.


Interfaces
==========

Pipeline Inputs
---------------
The data input to the pipeline is the input to stage01_data_entry. The path to the data file is given in the config file of this first stage as key-value pair (``<data_name>: /path/to/file``) in ``DATA_SETS``, and loaded by the custom data entry scripts specified in ``CURATION_SCRIPT``. Additional metadata can be specified in the same config file. For details see the `stage01 README <https://cobrawap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stage01_data_entry.html#entering-datasets-into-cobrawap>`_.

Pipeline Outputs
----------------
The output of the pipeline is the output of all the selected stages. Thus,  final result is the output of the final stage, whereas other stage output can be regarded as intermediate results. The file format of data and figures is determined by the parameters ``NEO_FORMAT`` and ``PLOT_FORMAT``.
All are stored in ``{output_path}/{profile}`` in a folder structure representing the corresponding structure of stages and block (see `Figure Folder Structure <#organization>`_).

Stage Inputs
------------
The path to the input file for each stage is defined in the config parameter ``STAGE_INPUT``. When executing the full pipeline the stage inputs are automatically set to the outputs (``STAGE_OUTPUT``) of the previous stage, respectively. Details on the input requirements for each stage are specified in the corresponding stage ``README`` files and checked automatically via a ``check_input`` block in each stage.

Stage Outputs
-------------
The stage output file is stored as ``{output_path}/{profile}/{STAGE_NAME}/{STAGE_OUTPUT}/``, with ``STAGE_NAME``, and ``STAGE_OUTPUT`` taken from the corresponding config file and ``output_path`` from ``settings.py``.
Details on the output content and format for each stage are specified in the corresponding stage ``README`` files.

Block Inputs
------------
Input dependencies to blocks are handled by the corresponding rule in the *Snakefile* and are arranged according on the mechanics of the respective stage.

Block Outputs
-------------
All output from blocks (data and figures) is stored in ``{output_path}/{profile}/{STAGE_NAME}/{block_name}/``.
